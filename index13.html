      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-4">Introduction</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">After mastering the basics, beginners and intermediates can apply advanced techniques to maximize muscle growth, strength, and efficiency. These strategies are not mandatory but can accelerate progress when used intelligently and in moderation. Understanding when and how to implement them is key to safe and effective training.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-4">Exercise Variations</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">Introducing variations to standard lifts challenges muscles in new ways and prevents adaptation. Examples include paused squats, incline or decline presses, Romanian deadlifts, or one-arm rows. Varying grip, stance, or tempo engages different muscle fibers and improves overall strength and aesthetics.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-4">Advanced Set Techniques</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">Techniques such as supersets, drop sets, rest-pause sets, and tempo manipulation can increase intensity and metabolic stress. Supersets pair exercises for opposing or complementary muscles to save time and increase workload. Drop sets involve reducing weight after reaching failure to extend a set. Tempo changes — slowing eccentric or pausing at peak contraction — enhance time under tension and promote growth.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-4">Periodization and Program Cycling</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">Periodization involves systematically varying training intensity, volume, and focus over time. For example, a 4-week hypertrophy phase followed by a 4-week strength phase allows the body to adapt progressively and prevents plateaus. Program cycling also reduces overuse injuries and maintains motivation by providing structured variation.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-4">Incorporating Mobility and Prehabilitation</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">Advanced lifters often incorporate mobility, stretching, and prehabilitation exercises into their routine. Targeting weak points, stabilizing joints, and improving flexibility ensures long-term progress and reduces injury risk. Simple practices such as band work, foam rolling, and dynamic stretching can make a significant difference in performance and recovery.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-4">Tracking Micro-Adjustments</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">Small adjustments in load, rep speed, rest periods, or range of motion can have a cumulative impact over time. Advanced trainees track these micro-changes to fine-tune programs and continue progressive overload. Paying attention to these details allows for consistent improvement even when gains slow down.</p>
