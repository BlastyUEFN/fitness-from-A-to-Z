      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-4">The Importance of Recovery</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">Recovery is often overlooked but is as essential as your workouts. While training creates the stimulus for muscle growth and strength gains, it’s during rest that your muscles repair and adapt. Without sufficient recovery, performance declines, the risk of injury increases, and progress slows. Recovery encompasses both active rest between workouts and passive rest like sleep.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-4">Sleep and Its Role in Growth</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">Sleep is the most critical form of recovery. During deep sleep, your body releases growth hormone, which aids in muscle repair and overall recovery. Most adults require 7–9 hours of quality sleep per night to optimize performance and adaptation. Poor sleep can negatively affect strength, coordination, and the body’s ability to build muscle, making it as important as your nutrition and training.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-4">Rest Days and Training Frequency</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">Rest days are crucial for both beginners and intermediates. Beginners often benefit from 2–3 rest days per week, while intermediates using split routines can train 4–6 days, but still require at least one full rest day. Rest days allow muscles to recover, joints to repair, and the nervous system to reset. Overtraining without adequate rest can lead to fatigue, reduced performance, and even injury.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-4">Active Recovery Techniques</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">Active recovery involves light activity on rest days to promote blood flow and reduce soreness. Activities such as walking, yoga, stretching, or low-intensity cycling can accelerate recovery without stressing the muscles. Incorporating mobility work and foam rolling can improve flexibility, reduce tension, and enhance long-term performance.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-4">Listening to Your Body</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">Understanding your body’s signals is key to optimizing recovery. Persistent soreness, fatigue, or declining performance may indicate you need additional rest. Adjusting intensity, volume, and rest days based on how your body feels can prevent overtraining and promote steady progress. Remember, recovery is not a luxury — it is an integral part of the training process.</p>
