      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-4">Understanding Motivation</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">Motivation is the driving force behind consistent training and progress. Understanding why you train — whether for strength, aesthetics, health, or personal challenge — helps maintain focus during difficult or low-energy days. Motivation can fluctuate, so developing habits and systems that support consistency is often more effective than relying solely on willpower.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-4">Setting Clear Goals</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">Define specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals. Examples include increasing squat weight by 10kg in three months or achieving a certain number of pull-ups. Clear goals provide direction and a benchmark to track progress, making it easier to stay motivated and recognize accomplishments along the way.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-4">Creating a Routine</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">Consistency is key for long-term success. Schedule workouts like appointments, and commit to a routine that fits your lifestyle. Habit formation reduces reliance on fluctuating motivation and ensures training becomes a natural part of your day. Even short, focused sessions are better than skipping entirely.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-4">Tracking Progress</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">Monitoring your progress reinforces motivation. Keep a log of workouts, weights, reps, and personal bests. Visual evidence of improvement boosts confidence and encourages continued effort. Tracking also allows you to identify plateaus or weaknesses, helping adjust your program and maintain forward momentum.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-4">Accountability and Support</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">Training with a friend, joining online communities, or having a coach provides external accountability and encouragement. Sharing goals, progress, and challenges can keep you consistent, while friendly competition or collaboration adds enjoyment and reinforcement to your training routine.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-4">Overcoming Setbacks</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">Injuries, plateaus, or busy schedules kunnen disrupt progress. Anticipate setbacks and plan strategies to minimize their impact, such as modifying workouts, focusing on recovery, or temporarily adjusting intensity. Maintaining a long-term perspective and embracing flexibility ensures setbacks do not derail your overall progress.</p>
