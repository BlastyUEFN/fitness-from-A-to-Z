    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-4">Introduction</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">Even with the best guidance, beginners and intermediates often make mistakes that slow progress or increase the risk of injury. Recognizing and addressing these common errors ensures you maximize gains while training safely. Awareness and intentional adjustments can make a big difference in the effectiveness of your workouts.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-4">Skipping Warm-Ups and Mobility Work</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">Many trainees neglect warm-ups, which can lead to poor performance and higher injury risk. Spend 5–10 minutes on general cardio and mobility drills before lifting. Target specific joints and muscles used in your session to improve range of motion, activate the nervous system, and prepare your body for heavy loads.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-4">Poor Form and Technique</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">Lifting with improper form is one of the most common mistakes. It not only reduces effectiveness but also increases injury risk. Start with lighter weights to learn correct movement patterns and focus on mind-muscle connection. Gradually increase weight while maintaining precise form. Periodically reviewing technique prevents bad habits from forming.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-4">Neglecting Progressive Overload</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">Without systematically increasing weight, reps, sets, or intensity, muscles adapt to the same stimulus and growth plateaus. Keep track of your workouts, aim for small, incremental improvements, and vary overload methods to continue making strength and size gains.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-4">Ignoring Recovery and Sleep</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">Overtraining or not prioritizing rest days and quality sleep hampers progress. Muscles grow during recovery, not during workouts. Incorporate sufficient rest between sessions, prioritize 7–9 hours of sleep per night, and consider active recovery to reduce soreness and improve performance.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-4">Inconsistent Nutrition</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">Diet plays a critical role in achieving your goals. Skipping meals, inadequate protein, or poor calorie management can limit strength and muscle gains. Aim for balanced meals with sufficient protein, carbohydrates for energy, and healthy fats for hormonal support. Consistency over time is more important than perfection on any single day.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-4">Neglecting Key Muscle Groups</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">Focusing only on favorite exercises or visible muscles like chest and arms can lead to imbalances, postural issues, and limited strength. Include compound lifts and accessory work to train all major muscle groups evenly, promoting functional strength and long-term progress.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">Being aware of these common mistakes allows you to train smarter, safer, and more effectively. Focus on proper form, progressive overload, balanced nutrition, adequate recovery, and full-body development. Small, consistent improvements and intentional adjustments lead to sustainable growth and long-term success in your fitness journey.</p>
